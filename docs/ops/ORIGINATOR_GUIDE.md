## 🤖 Meet Jason: Your Administrative Assistant
Jason handles the front-end of our **11-touch follow-up series**. He qualifies leads, manages initial objections, and orchestrates touch-points across voice, SMS, and email—allowing you to be the expert pilot of your pipeline.

---

## 📥 How You Win: The Handoff Process
Jason is designed to identify "Hot Leads" and connect them with you effortlessly. You’ll see his work in Salesforce in two key ways:

✅ **High-Priority Task Alerts**: When Jason identifies a ready-to-move borrower, he creates a Salesforce Task for you: `🔥 ACTION REQUIRED: Appointment Booked via AI.`
✅ **Real-Time Call Logs**: Every interaction is logged as a closed task. Review Jason’s **AI Notes** to understand the borrower’s goals before you pick up the phone.

## 📋 Managing Your Workflow
*   **Review the Story**: Before calling a lead, check the Salesforce notes. Jason records interest in VA, Conventional, or Jumbo programs and captures any specific concerns.
*   **Update and Move More**: Simply update the Lead Status after you speak with a client. This tells Jason whether to continue his follow-up cadence or step back while you close the deal.

## 📈 The 11-Touch Series
Jason manages the procedural heavy lifting during the early stages of the funnel.

*   **Move More with Automation**: Jason handles the outbound calls, SMS, and email follow-ups to keep your brand top-of-mind.
*   **Your Time to Shine**: You enter the flow when a borrower is qualified or requests a professional conversation with a licensed originator.

---

## 🤝 Protecting Your License
*   **Expert Advice**: Jason is forbidden from quoting rates. He will always defer to your expertise for official loan programs and APRs.
*   **Total Transparency**: Jason identifies as an AI in his first 2 seconds, ensuring a clear and honest connection with every borrower.

## 💡 Best Practices for Success
1.  **Speed to Lead**: When you receive a task from Jason, try to follow up within 60 minutes for the best connection rate.
2.  **Trust the Context**: Start your call with a warm intro: *"I see you were just speaking with my assistant Jason about a VA streamline refinance..."*
