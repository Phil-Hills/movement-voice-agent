## ⚡ Zero-Tech Friction: Your Focus is People
At Company, we believe you shouldn't have to be a technologist to be a top producer. Agent is designed to handle 100% of the technical heavy lifting, allowing you to spend your time where it matters: **connecting with borrowers.**

## 🤖 Meet Agent: Your Administrative Assistant
Agent handles the front-end of our **11-touch follow-up series**. He qualifies leads, manages initial objections, and orchestrates touch-points across voice, SMS, and email—allowing you to be the expert pilot of your pipeline.

## 📥 How You Win: The Handoff Process
Agent is designed to identify "Hot Leads" and connect them with you effortlessly. You’ll see his work in Salesforce in two key ways:

✅ **High-Priority Task Alerts**: When Agent identifies a ready-to-move borrower, he creates a Salesforce Task for you: `🔥 ACTION REQUIRED: Appointment Booked via AI.`
✅ **Real-Time Call Logs**: Every interaction is logged as a closed task. Review Agent’s **AI Notes** to understand the borrower’s goals before you pick up the phone.

## 📋 Managing Your Workflow
*   **Review the Story**: Before calling a lead, check the Salesforce notes. Agent records interest in VA, Conventional, or Jumbo programs and captures any specific concerns.
*   **Update and Move More**: Simply update the Lead Status after you speak with a client. This tells Agent whether to continue his follow-up cadence or step back while you close the deal.

## 📈 The 11-Touch Series
Agent manages the procedural heavy lifting during the early stages of the funnel.

*   **Move More with Automation**: Agent handles the outbound calls, SMS, and email follow-ups to keep your brand top-of-mind.
*   **Your Time to Shine**: You enter the flow when a borrower is qualified or requests a professional conversation with a licensed originator.

## 🤝 Protecting Your License
*   **Expert Advice**: Agent is forbidden from quoting rates. He will always defer to your expertise for official loan programs and APRs.
*   **Total Transparency**: Agent identifies as an AI in his first 2 seconds, ensuring a clear and honest connection with every borrower.
