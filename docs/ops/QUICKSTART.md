## ⚡ 1. The 60-Second Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and your `.env` populated with a **Google AI API Key**.

```bash
# Preparation
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 2. Launch the Brain
Run the core orchestrator to initialize the A2AC swarm protocol:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Check your terminal for the ✅ **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking initialized** status.

## 🎙️ 3. Witness the "Thinking"
Jason doesn't just talk; he plans. Trigger a mock reasoning pass to see how he protects your license:

```bash
python3 scripts/simulate_handoff.py
```

Watch for the **BLAKE3 Thought Signature** and the mandatory **NMLS Safety Gate** trigger when simulated rates are requested.
