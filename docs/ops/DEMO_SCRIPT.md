: Voice Agent Agent [Project: Agent]

**Duration**: ~3 Minutes | **Target**: Stakeholders, CISO, and Loan Officers

---

## 🎬 Act 1: The Vision (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Screen share of the **Brutalist Monitor CLI** (`scripts/monitor.sh`) with activity scrolling.

**Narrator**: 
"Meet Agent. He isn't just a chatbot; he’s a production-hardened manifestation of the **A2AC Swarm**. Built by Systems Architect **Architect**, this agent operates on the **Q Protocol**—a decentralized orchestration layer that decouples intent from execution to provide a state-of-the-art security posture."

"Today, we’re looking at Revision 4.1.0—a system modularized for speed, secured for enterprise audits, and fully integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem."

---

## 🏗️ Act 2: Architectural Elegance (0:45 - 1:30)
**Visual**: Show the `README.md` Mermaid diagram, then quickly flip through `core/agent_engine.py` and `core/salesforce_app.py`.

**Narrator**:
"Under the hood, Agent uses a 'Reasoner-Talker' loop. Every response is double-passed: Gemini Thinking plans the logic, ensuring strictly verified compliance and zero **hallucinations**, while Gemini Flash delivers the concise voice output."

"Every step is cryptographically grounded with a SHA256 'Thought Signature'. This means the agent's reasoning is deterministic, auditable, and grounded in the AI Lab's protocols for **Absolute Semantic Decoupling**."

---

## 📞 Act 3: Live Orchestration (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Start a simulated campaign in the Dashboard. Show a 'Connected' call. Switch to Salesforce to show a newly created Task.

**Narrator**:
"Leveraging Vonage Voice APIs, Agent orchestrates a persistent 11-touch cadence. He isn’t just talking; he’s taking action. Watch as Agent completes a call, analyzes the disposition, and automatically creates a high-priority follow-up task in Salesforce for an NMLS Originator."

"He handles the handoff, logs the AI's 'reasoning' into the CRM, and updates the lead's cadence step—all without a single human click."

---

## 🎬 Act 4: Compliant Licensing Duties (2:15 - 2:45)
**Visual**: Split screen showing the "Licensing Duty Gate" diagram vs a live Handoff notification.

**Narrator**: 
"But Agent isn't here to replace you. He’s here to make you a Strategic Pilot. He operates behind a strict **Licensing Duty Gate**. While Agent handles the administrative heavy lifting—document chasing and partner outreach—he is explicitly forbidden from performing licensed duties like rate quoting or terms negotiation. Whenever a client asks for a rate, Agent triggers a mandatory handoff to the licensed Originator. This ensures 100% compliance with NMLS licensing duties while freeing your experts to focus on the human side of the deal."

---

## 🎬 Act 5: The Human in the Loop (2:45 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Screen showing a Salesforce Task list with "Agent Handoffs" at the top.

**Narrator**:
"This is the 'Day in the Life' of the 2026 Originator. While you focus on the complex, multi-million dollar closings, Agent is chasing missing W2s, recruiting new Real Estate partners, and signing his thoughts with cryptographic signatures for your review. This is the end of cold-calling, and the beginning of Cognitive Luxury."

---

## 🏁 Closing (3:00 - End)
**Visual**: Logo of **AI Lab** with the text: **ABSOLUTE SEMANTIC DECOUPLING**.

**Narrator**:
"The Voice Agent Agent. Built on the Q Protocol. Deployed by the AI Lab. The Action Era of AI is here. Let's build the future of finance, together."
"The Voice Agent Agent: Professional. Autonomous. Compliant. The future of mortgage sales starts here."
