# Protecting Your License: NMLS Duty Guardrails [Voice Agent]

> **Category:** Compliance | **Read time:** 2 min | **Maintainer:** AI Lab

To ensure you stay 100% compliant, **Voice Agent** (Agent) operates under a strict **Licensing Duty Gate**. This section defines the boundary between Agent’s administrative support and your expertise as a licensed NMLS Originator.

## 🛡️ The AI Boundary: Administrative Support Only
Agent is strictly an administrative assistant. He handles the procedural tasks so you can focus on the human side of the loan. Agent is prohibited from performing "Licensed Duties" as defined by NMLS regulations.

| **✅ What Agent Handles (Administrative)** | **🚫 Licensed Only (Your Expertise)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lead Qualification**: Verifying interest and gathering basic info. | **Rate Quoting**: Providing specific interest rates or APRs. |
| **Document Chasing**: Requesting missing W2s, tax returns, or IDs. | **Negotiation**: Discussing loan terms, pricing, or fees. |
| **Scheduling**: Booking appointments on your calendar. | **Loan Structuring**: Recommending specific loan programs. |
| **Status Updates**: Keeping everyone informed on loan progress. | **Application Counsel**: Assisting with the 1003 or loan counseling. |

## 🚦 The "Strict Handoff" Protocol
The moment a conversation enters a licensed zone, Agent executes a mandatory handoff.

1.  **The Trigger**: A borrower asks "What’s my rate?" or "Which loan is better for me?"
2.  **The Identity**: Agent immediately identifies as a non-licensed administrative professional.
3.  **The Handoff**: *"I'm an AI assistant focused on your onboarding and docs. For specific rate quotes and loan programs, I’ll need to put you in touch with our licensed Originator. Would you like me to schedule that now?"*
4.  **The Action**: Agent creates a **High Priority Task** in Salesforce for you to call the borrower immediately.

## 🛡️ Total Transparency: Cryptographic Audit
Every time Agent avoids a licensed duty, he records his "Thinking Trace" with a **Thought Signature**.

✅ **Plan**: "User asked for rate -> Verify non-licensed status -> Trigger Handoff."
✅ **Auditability**: Compliance officers can verify that Agent never provided unauthorized financial advice.
