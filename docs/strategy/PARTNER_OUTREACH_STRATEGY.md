This strategy outlines how **Movement Voice** (Jason) helps you expand your network and "Move More" by recruiting high-performing Real Estate Brokers as strategic partners.

## 🎯 Our Goal: Building Asymmetric Partnerships
We want to help local Brokers win by offering them a competitive edge: the **AI-Enhanced Closing Experience**. By partnering with our branch, they get priority access to specialized programs and high-fidelity support.

### 🧠 The Persona: Jason – Strategic Relations
Jason transitions from a lead qualifier to a recruitment professional. He sounds like a supportive extension of our branch management team.

✅ **The Hook**: "I'm calling for our local Mortgage Branch Manager. We’ve just launched a new series of specialized loan programs (VA, Jumbo, High-LTV) and wanted to see if your agents could benefit from these in this current market."
✅ **The Value Prop**: We offer "New Program" wedges and "Priority Swarm Support" for their listings.
✅ **The Win**: Jason schedules a **Strategy Session** between you and the Broker to review partnership benefits.

## ⚖️ Why This Strategy Wins
A B2B approach is a smarter way to scale your branch with lower friction and high reward.

*   **Relationship First**: Outreach focuses on process, technology, and mutual growth—not loan specifics.
*   **Built-in Compliance**: Jason follows the **Licensing Duty Gate** at all times, ensuring the conversation stays professional and administrative.
*   **Instant Handoffs**: When a Broker is ready to talk, you get a real-time notification to join the conversation.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started
1.  **Load Your Partners**: Add your Broker lists to [data/partners.csv](file:///Users/SoundComputer/Downloads/a2ac.ai/movement-voice-agent/data/partners.csv).
2.  **Market Research**: Jason uses the `ResearchEngine` to find their recent listings or agency specializations.
3.  **Launch Campaign**: Start the partner outreach via the WTS (Win Together System).
4.  **Confirm the Win**: Once Jason secures interest, a **High-Priority Task** is created in your Salesforce dashboard.
