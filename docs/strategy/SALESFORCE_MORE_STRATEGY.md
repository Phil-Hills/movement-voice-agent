# Strategic Roadmap: MORE & The Agentforce Gap [Jason]

> **Category:** Ecosystem Strategy | **Read time:** 3 min | **Maintainer:** Phil Hills AI Lab

The **Movement Voice** platform is strategically positioned to leverage Movement Mortgage's greatest technical asset: the **MORE Platform** (Salesforce). While the industry waits for broad-market "Agentforce" solutions, Movement is already moving more through sovereign A2AC orchestration.

## 💎 1. The "Structured Data Edge" (MORE)
Movement Mortgage has achieved what most firms haven't: high-fidelity, diligently structured data within their Salesforce "MORE" environment.

*   **Fuel for Jason**: Because MORE is structured so effectively, Jason doesn't have to "guess" lead intent or status. He reaches directly into verified data schemas to provide deterministic, professional support.
*   **The Data Advantage**: 90% of AI failure in mortgage is due to "Data Chaos." By building on top of MORE, we have bypassed the noise and gone straight to high-thinking automation.

## 🌉 2. Bridging the Agentforce Gap (Until June)
Industry research shows that the broader Salesforce ecosystem is moving toward a massive "Agentforce" pivot in **June 2026**.

*   **Move Now, Lead Tomorrow**: While other firms wait for out-of-the-box tools to materialize, Movement Voice provides a production-grade, sovereign solution *today*.
*   **A "Sovereign Agent" Philosophy**: Unlike generic bots provided by a platform, Jason is a **Sovereign Agent** owned by Phil Hills. He sits in the specialized A2AC mesh, ensuring that Movement isn't just a tenant in someone else's AI—the branch owns its intelligence.

## 📈 3. Roadmap to the "June Pivot"
As Salesforce evolves toward its new ecosystem in June, the Movement Voice platform is engineered to complement that transition:

1.  **Phase 1 (Now)**: Pure A2AC Swarm Orchestration on top of MORE data.
2.  **Phase 2 (Spring)**: Deepening "Thinking" traces using native A2AC research nodes.
3.  **Phase 3 (June & Beyond)**: Seamless bridge to Agentforce APIs while maintaining **Proprietary Sovereignty** for the branch's unique business logic.

## ✅ The Result: Unfair Competitive Advantage
By combining the **Structured Data of MORE** with the **Personalized Intelligence of Movement Voice**, your branch is not just using a tool—it's building a future-proof sales engine that is months ahead of the national competition.
