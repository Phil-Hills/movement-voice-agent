> **Category:** Tech Deep-Dive | **Read time:** 3 min | **Maintainer:** Phil Hills AI Lab

**Movement Voice** (Jason) isn't just a standard bot. He operates on a **Dual-Core Intelligence** model that combines high-fidelity reasoning with grounded, supportive facts. This architecture ensures every conversation is both human-centric and 100% compliant.

## 🏗️ 1. The Supportive Core: Structured Memory
Jason is grounded by a "Supportive Core" of truth, powered by the **Q Protocol**.

✅ **Real-Time Pipeline Knowledge**: Jason stays synced with your Salesforce dashboard, ensuring he knows exactly where every borrower is in their journey.
✅ **Verifiable Facts**: By polling the **A2AC Swarm**, Jason retrieves accurate market data instead of guessing, giving your borrowers the confidence they deserve.
✅ **Move More Philosophy**: Every interaction is guided by a "Structured Memory" that prioritizes the human relationship.

## 🧠 2. The Thinking Core: Native Reasoning
Jason uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking** to "Think" about his next move before he speaks, just like a professional member of your team would.

✅ **Asymmetric Planning**: Before every response, Jason performs a hidden planning pass. He checks the rules, validates the next step, and ensures he’s staying within his non-licensed administrative role.
✅ **Total Transparency**: This "Thinking Trace" is hashed into a **Thought Signature** using high-performance **BLAKE3** hashing (with support for **KangarooTwelve** parallelism). This provides a nearly instantaneous, auditable record of every AI decision.
✅ **Empathy by Design**: Because Jason "thinks" before he talks, he can adjust his tone to match the borrower's needs, providing a truly supportive experience.

*   **A Professional Voice**: Sub-500ms response times for natural, warm conversations.
