## 👤 1. Originator Level: Cost Per Connection
At the LO level, our goal is to drive the "Cost per Qualified Lead" as low as possible while maintaining high human fidelity.

| **Operational Metric** | **Estimated Cost** | **ROI Impact** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outbound Voice Call** | ~$0.15 - $0.25 / minute | Replaces $15/hr cold-calling labor. |
| **SMS Follow-up** | ~$0.01 / message | 100% open rate for instantaneous connection. |
| **Physical Mailer** | ~$1.20 - $2.50 / piece | Higher conversion for high-value broker partners. |
| **AI Reasoning (Thinking)** | <$0.01 / turn | Zero-hallucination compliance at a fraction of a cent. |

**✅ The LO Win**: You can run an entire 11-touch follow-up cadence for less than the cost of a single cup of coffee, reclaiming 5+ hours of your week.

## 🏢 3. Branch Level: Scalable Infrastructure
For the Branch Manager, Movement Voice transforms "Marketing Expense" into "Production Growth."

*   **Platform Orchestration**: A flat monthly subscription through the **MORE Marketplace** covers the core "Brain" and Salesforce sync.
*   **Elastic Scaling**: Costs only accrue when Jason is actively calling or researching. If you have a slow week, your costs drop automatically.
*   **B2B Outreach ROI**: One successful Real Estate Broker partnership pays for the entire branch's AI budget for an entire year.
*   **✅ The Branch Win**: 100% lead saturation with zero additional headcount.

## 🏛️ 3. Corporate Level: Enterprise Efficiency
At the organization level, we move from "Per Unit" cost to "Systemic Value."

*   **Regulatory Risk Mitigation**: The cost of a single compliance violation far outweighs the entire platform budget. Jason’s **Licensing Duty Gate** is an insurance policy for your brand.
*   **Infrastructure Consolidation**: By using the **Q Protocol** and **A2AC Swarm**, we eliminate fragmented vendor costs (separate dialers, research tools, and doc chasers) into a single, unified stack.
*   **Token Leverage**: We optimize Gemini 2.0 Flash usage to provide the highest intelligence at the lowest possible latency and cost.
*   **✅ The Corporate Win**: A predictable, secure, and highly efficient sales engine that sets a new industry standard for cost-to-close.
