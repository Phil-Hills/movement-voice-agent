## 🐝 The Agentic Swarm: A Smarter Way to Delegate
Agent doesn’t work alone. He is the "Voice Node" of a larger **A2AC (Agent-to-Agent Communication)** swarm, ensuring every part of the loan process is handled with precision.

✅ **A2AC Orchestration**: Agent can delegate deep market research, document validation, and CRM updates to specialized sub-agents.
✅ **The Q Protocol Service Mesh**: Our smarter infrastructure allows the swarm to spin up ephemeral "helpers" (like a Tax Transcript Analyzer) so you don't have to.

## 📡 Hyper-Channel Persistence: Total Lead Saturation
We use a **Multi-Node Communicator** model to ensure you never miss a connection.

✅ **Voice**: High-thinking calls to qualify leads and recruit professional partners.
✅ **SMS Follow-ups**: Quick confirmations and "on-my-way" messages to keep borrowers in the loop.
✅ **Email Intelligence**: Delivering program brochures and summaries directly to their inbox.
✅ **Physical Impact Mailers**: High-value "Impact Cards" sent via the MORE Marketplace to stay top-of-mind.

## 🤝 You are the Pilot: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
The platform is designed to be your co-pilot, not a replacement. You maintain total command authority.

✅ **Strategic Handoffs**: When Agent encounters complexity—like detailed rate negotiations—he immediately triggers a Salesforce Task for you.
✅ **Total Transparency**: Review Agent’s "Thinking Traces" and **Thought Signatures** at any time to see exactly how he’s helping your borrowers.
✅ **The Licensing Duty Gate**: Built-in guardrails ensure the AI never performs tasks that require your professional NMLS license.
