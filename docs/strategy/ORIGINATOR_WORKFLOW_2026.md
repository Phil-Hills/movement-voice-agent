## 📈 10:00 AM – Strategic Growth with Partner Outreach
While you’re busy with high-value closings, Jason is out in the market recruitment-mode.

✅ **Broker Connections**: Jason is calling 20 local Real Estate agents to pitch our new specialized loan programs.

## 🛠️ 01:00 PM – Smarter Document Chasing
Let Jason handle the procedural heavy lifting of document collection.

✅ **Automated Follow-ups**: Mark a loan as "Processing," and Jason automatically takes over chasing the borrower for that 2025 W2.
✅ **Document Integrity Check**: The moment a borrower uploads, our **Document Agent** verifies the file. Blur or errors? Jason calls the borrower immediately to fix it—without you ever touching a phone.

## 🏁 04:30 PM – Relationship Reinforcement
The conversation doesn’t end at funding. Jason helps you stay connected forever.

✅ **Hyper-Channel Touchpoints**: Jason makes the 6-month check-in call and triggers a "Happy Anniversary" physical mailer via the MORE Marketplace.
✅ **Recapture Alerts**: When rates drop, Jason identifies the opportunity and presents you with a ready-to-use recapture script.

## 🎯 The Result: Move More with Cognitive Luxury
