**Duration**: ~3 Minutes | **Target**: Stakeholders, CISO, and Loan Officers

---

## 🎬 Act 1: The Vision (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Screen share of the **Brutalist Monitor CLI** (`scripts/monitor.sh`) with activity scrolling.

**Narrator**: 
"Meet Jason. He isn't just a chatbot; he’s the world’s first production-hardened, autonomous mortgage specialist. Built for the Action Era of AI, the Core Voice Agent handles the grueling work of outbound qualification so your originators can focus on one thing: closing."

"Today, we’re looking at Revision 4.1.0—a system modularized for speed, secured for enterprise audits, and fully integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem."

## 🏗️ Act 2: Architectural Elegance (0:45 - 1:30)
**Visual**: Show the `README.md` Mermaid diagram, then quickly flip through `core/agent_engine.py` and `core/salesforce_app.py`.

**Narrator**:
"Under the hood, Jason is powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash with native thinking traces. We’ve implemented a Talker-Reasoner architecture that achieves sub-500ms response times while still performing complex mortgage logic."

"Every decision Jason makes is cryptographically signed with a SHA256 'Thought Signature', ensuring a tamper-proof audit trail. And for the CISO, we’ve implemented air-gapped data sovereignty—every lead in this demo is fully sanitized, protecting PII while maintaining high-fidelity realism."

## 📞 Act 3: Live Orchestration (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Start a simulated campaign in the Dashboard. Show a 'Connected' call. Switch to Salesforce to show a newly created Task.

**Narrator**:
"Leveraging Vonage Voice APIs, Jason orchestrates a persistent 11-touch cadence. He isn’t just talking; he’s taking action. Watch as Jason completes a call, analyzes the disposition, and automatically creates a high-priority follow-up task in Salesforce for an NMLS Originator."

"He handles the handoff, logs the AI's 'reasoning' into the CRM, and updates the lead's cadence step—all without a single human click."

---

## 🏁 Act 4: The Handoff (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Show `ORIGINATOR_GUIDE.md` and then finish on the logo/repo URL.

**Narrator**:
"We provide your team with the 'Originator Guide' and 'Admin Manual' to ensure a seamless rollout. This is more than a tool; it’s a force multiplier for your sales floor."

"The Core Voice Agent: Professional. Autonomous. Compliant. The future of mortgage sales starts here."
