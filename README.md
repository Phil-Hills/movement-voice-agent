## 🏛️ VISION: COGNITIVE LUXURY
The **Core Voice Agent** (Project: Jason) is the definitive implementation of the Phil Hills AI Lab's agentic orchestration framework. It transforms the mortgage lead lifecycle into a state of **Cognitive Luxury**—where human expertise is elevated through asymmetric AI support.

## 🐝 THE AGENTIC SWARM (A2AC)
Built on the **Q Protocol**, Jason acts as the "Voice Node," delegating complex tasks to specialized agents:
- **Research Agent**: Live grounding and market analysis.
- **Salesforce Agent**: Persistent state management and task creation.
- **Reviewer Agent**: Real-time compliance auditing of every reasoning trace.

---

## ⚖️ REGULATORY HARDENING
In the "Land of Mortgage," trust is powered by deterministic compliance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Licensing Duty Gate**: Jason is explicitly forbidden from performing licensed duties (rate quoting, terms negotiation). Any violation triggers a mandatory handoff to a human NMLS Originator.

> [!NOTE]
> **Cryptographic Grounding**: Every response is planed in a hidden reasoning pass and signed with a SHA256 `thought_signature`.
