## 🚨 The Problem: The "Admin Trap"
*   **The Reality**: Loan Officers spend **70% of their time** on low-value tasks.
    *   Chasing W2s.
    *   Leaving voicemails.
    *   Updating CRM fields.
*   **The Cost**: Missed opportunities and creative burnout.
*   **The Result**: You aren't "Moving More"—you're just moving paper.
